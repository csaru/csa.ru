Held in conjunction with **the 18<sup>th</sup>International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA 2018)**<br/>
Melbourne, Australia, July 2-5, 2018<br/>

### Call for papers

Advancements in computing platforms research allow building complex systems which help conduct virtual experiments: setup virtual testbeds, fetch input data, run a computing experiment, compare its output to outputs of similar experiments and organize obtained results in a convenient way for further retrieval and processing by other researchers. These systems are composed of a variety of distributed components and there are numerous ways to tie them together. 

The majority of current computing architectures are based on virtualized components; thus one of the fundamental questions of building computing architectures is forming a virtual computing environment according to the computational problem and creating tools to control it.

The emergence of new types of processors and accelerators changes the paradigm of executing applications on computing systems. New approaches to the issues of using vector accelerators and matrix calculations in general are of high priority.

The objective of the workshop is to show modern techniques on constructing such complex computing systems and to share usage and maintenance experience.

### Topics 

The topics of the SCIâ€™18 workshop include but are not limited to:

- Distributed, grid and cloud information systems;
- Distributed system and application performance monitoring;
- Virtualization, application containers and delivery techniques;
- Distributed databases, key-value stores and parallel file systems for high-performance computing;
- Scientific and general workflow systems, scientific virtual experiment tracking and data provenance;
- Application portability for heterogeneous and homogeneous distributed computer systems;
- Infrastructure of specialized Learning Management Systems;
- Computational environments for numerical modeling of complex natural phenomena and technical processes.

Accepted papers will be published by Springer-Verlag in the conference
proceedings that will be indexed in Scopus and Web of Science.

### Important dates

April 8, 2018: Notification of Acceptance and Early-bird Registration starts.<br/>
May 6, 2018: Early-bird Registration ends.<br/>
May 6, 2018: Submission deadline for the final version of the Papers<br/>
July 2-5, 2018: ICCSA 2018 Conference

### Paper submission

To submit a paper, please connect to the submission site from the link provided
at the ICCSA 2018 web site: <http://ess.iccsa.org>. Only papers submitted
through the electronic system and strictly adhering to the relevant format will
be considered for reviewing and publication.

_The submission must fall into the following category: Scientific Computing Infrastructure (SCI 2018) workshop paper._

The submitted paper must be between 10 to 16 pages long for LNCS publication
and should be formatted according to the LNCS rules, respectively. Please
consult the URL <http://www.iccsa.org/instructions-for-authors> for formatting
information and templates. Each paper must deal with original and unpublished
work, not submitted for publication elsewhere (copyright problems fall entirely
under responsibility of the authors). Each paper will be reviewed by at least
three experts in the relevant field, ensuring the publication of only top
quality contributions.

When a paper is accepted at least one of the authors has to register to the
Conference and orally present the paper at the Workshop. Accepted papers will
be published by Springer-Verlag in the Conference proceedings. Each participant
will receive the electronic copy of all the proceeding volumes (LNCS) on a USB
key. For a selected number of top quality papers, after the Conference, the
authors will be requested to extend the paper in order to be published as
special issues in Transactions on Computational Science.
