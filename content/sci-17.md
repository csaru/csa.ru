Held in conjunction with **the 17<sup>th</sup>International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA 2017)**<br/>
Trieste, Italy, July 3-6, 2017<br/>
<http://www.iccsa.org/>

### Call for papers

Advancements in computing platforms research allow building complex systems
which help conduct virtual experiments: setup virtual testbeds, fetch input
data, run experiment, compare its output to outputs of similar experiments and
organize obtained results in a convenient way for further retrieval and
processing by other researchers. These systems are composed of a variety of
distributed components and there are numerous ways to tie them together. The
objective of the workshop is to show modern techniques on constructing such
complex systems and share usage and maintenance experience.

### Topics 

The topics of the SCIâ€™17 workshop include but are not limited to:

- Distributed, grid and cloud information systems;
- Distributed system and application performance monitoring;
- Virtualization, application containers and delivery techniques;
- Distributed databases, key-value stores and parallel file systems for high-performance computing;
- Scientific and general workflow systems, scientific virtual experiment tracking and data provenance;
- Application portability for heterogeneous and homogeneous distributed computer systems.

Accepted papers will be published by Springer-Verlag in the conference
proceedings that will be indexed in Scopus and Web of Science.

### Important dates

~~March 20, 2016~~ - extended till April 10,2016: Submission deadline<br/>
~~April 20, 2016~~ - extended till April 28, 2016: Notification of Acceptance and Early-bird Registration starts.<br/>
May 15, 2016: Early-bird Registration ends.<br/>
May 15, 2016: Submission deadline for the final version of the Papers<br/>
July 4-7, 2016: ICCSA 2016 Conference

### Paper submission

To submit a paper, please connect to the submission site from the link provided
at the ICCSA 2017 web site: <http://ess.iccsa.org>. Only papers submitted
through the electronic system and strictly adhering to the relevant format will
be considered for reviewing and publication.

_The submission must fall into the following category: Scientific Computing Infrastructure (SCI 2016) workshop paper._

The submitted paper must be between 10 to 16 pages long for LNCS publication
and should be formatted according to the LNCS rules, respectively. Please
consult the URL <http://www.iccsa.org/authors-instructions> for formatting
information and templates. Each paper must deal with original and unpublished
work, not submitted for publication elsewhere (copyright problems fall entirely
under responsibility of the authors). Each paper will be reviewed by at least
three experts in the relevant field, ensuring the publication of only top
quality contributions.

When a paper is accepted at least one of the authors has to register to the
Conference and orally present the paper at the Workshop. Accepted papers will
be published by Springer-Verlag in the Conference proceedings. Each participant
will receive the electronic copy of all the proceeding volumes (LNCS) on a USB
key. For a selected number of top quality papers, after the Conference, the
authors will be requested to extend the paper in order to be published as
special issues in Transactions on Computational Science.
